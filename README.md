## Regression
This here contains a regression analysis in Python. Given COVID_19 data that contains different features such as tests by age groups, race etc. I predict the number of positive and negative tests using regression models such as Linear Regression (Least Squares), Lasso, Ridge & Polynomial Regression, as well as K-NN and Random Forest.
